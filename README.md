CSV Viewer

Introduction

This project is a web-based application built with modern technologies to simplify CSV file management and analysis. It empowers users to upload, visualize, and interact with data stored in CSV format.

Key Features

Seamless File Upload: Effortlessly upload CSV files to the application for further analysis.
Comprehensive File List: Maintain a clear overview of all uploaded CSV files for easy access and management.
Interactive Tables: Explore and manipulate data from your CSV files within a dynamic table interface. Sorting and filtering capabilities provide granular control over your data.
Bar Chart Analysis: Gain insights from your data using visually compelling bar charts. Analyze trends, patterns, and relationships within your datasets.
Technology Stack

Frontend: React, Next.js (for a performant and SEO-friendly user interface)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js (for robust server-side functionality)
Database: MongoDB (via Mongoose) (for scalable and flexible data storage)
File Upload: Multer (efficiently handles file uploads)
Data Visualization: D3.js (creates interactive bar charts)
Cloud Storage: Cloudinary (securely stores and manages uploaded CSV files)
Project Structure

This project follows a well-organized directory structure to maintain code clarity and manageability:

Before embarking on your data exploration journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:


Node.js and npm: These provide the foundation for running the application.
MongoDB Server: A database instance is essential for storing your CSV data.
Cloudinary Account: Create an account for secure and reliable cloud storage of your CSV files.
Installation

Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/csv-viewer.git
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Navigate to Project Directory:

Bash
cd csv-viewer
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Install Dependencies:

Bash
npm install
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a file named .env.local in the project's root directory. This file will store sensitive information (avoid committing it to version control). Add the following variables, replacing the placeholders with your actual credentials:

MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
Running the Application

Start the Development Server:
Bash
npm run dev
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This command will launch the application in development mode, typically accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

API Endpoints

The application exposes a set of RESTful APIs for interacting with uploaded CSV files:

GET /api/csv: Retrieves a list of all uploaded CSV files.
GET /api/csv/:id: Fetches a specific CSV file by its unique identifier.
POST /api/upload: Uploads a new CSV file to the application.
DELETE /api/csv/delete/:id: Deletes a specific CSV file.
Usage

Upload a CSV File: Use the provided file upload component to add CSV files to your project.

View Uploaded Files: The sidebar displays a list of all uploaded CSV files for easy access.

Explore Data in Tables: Click on a file in the list to view its data within an interactive table. Sorting and filtering capabilities allow you to delve deeper into your data.

Analyze Data with Charts: Optionally, utilize the bar chart feature to gain visual insights from your CSV datasets. Identify trends, patterns, and relationships within your data more effectively.
